I made this for the Genshin Impact first anniversay event,
I did not start with a blank livery (I couldn't find one),
a JAL livery was blanked out and used for this, so there might
be some remains left over from the previous livery it overlays.

That's pretty much it lol, feel free to download it and use it in X-Plane.

Download the folder into [.\X-Plane 11\Aircraft\Laminar Research\Boeing B747-400\liveries] and 
select Genshin Impact as the livery on the 747-400 when you open the simulator.

If you do not have a Liveries folder in the 747-400 folder, you can create one and label it 'liveries'.

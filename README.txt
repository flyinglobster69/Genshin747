I made this for the Genshin Impact first anniversay event. That's pretty much it lol, feel free to download it and use it in X-Plane.

Download and unzip the compressed folder in [.\X-Plane 11\Aircraft\Laminar Research\Boeing B747-400\liveries] and select Genshin Impact as the livery on the 747-400 when you open the simulator.
